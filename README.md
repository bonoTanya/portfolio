# Project Title: Enhancing Customer Trust through Sustainable Initiatives: An AI-Driven Approach 
## The project is located in the AI-based Sentiment Analysis Folder as HSBC Project

### Project Description:
In a world increasingly focused on sustainability, businesses face the challenge of authentically expressing their commitment to sustainable development. HSBC, a leading global bank, aimed to foster a deeper and more sincere connection with its customers in relation to green initiatives, all while avoiding direct advertising. The goal was to build trust and credibility around the bank's environmental activism. To achieve this, the project employed data science and artificial intelligence techniques.

### Approach:
Three distinct strategies were formulated to address this challenge without directly promoting the bank's green initiatives. These strategies were designed to subtly convey HSBC's sincere commitment to sustainable development to its customers.

To gauge customer perspectives on these strategies, an online survey was conducted. Participants were asked to express their thoughts and attitudes toward each strategy in a few sentences. The next step was to employ AI-based sentiment analysis, using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) model. This model effectively analyzed people's opinions and emotions, providing a numerical estimation of the sentiments associated with each strategy. The methodology calculated a satisfaction score on a scale from 1 to 5 for each response, producing a distribution of estimated emotions for each strategy.

These distributions of customer sentiments were summarized by their mean values and compared using the statistical method of a t-test. This statistical approach helped identify the most effective strategy, as perceived by the survey participants.

### Results:
As a result of this research, the project was able to quantify overall customer emotions associated with the strategies, effectively identifying the most successful approach in addressing the research problem. The investigation did face constraints due to sample size limitations caused by time constraints.

This research not only offered valuable insights and potential solutions for HSBC to enhance its customer relationships through sustainable initiatives but also contributed to the field of BERT-based sentiment analysis, showcasing a novel application of this cutting-edge technology.

In summary, this project serves as an innovative approach to bridge the gap between a corporate entity's sustainability efforts and its customers, potentially paving the way for more meaningful and authentic interactions in the era of sustainable development. Furthermore, it contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of AI-driven sentiment analysis.
