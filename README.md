# portfolio
The portfolio showcases academic work from master's course assignments, demonstrating practical expertise in Applied Statistics, Econometrics, Mathematical Finance, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, it includes projects utilizing Excel and SQL for analyzing sales data and formulating performance improvement recommendations, a Python project addressing a company's churn issue, and a functional specification report from my Albany Beck Business Analysis training.

## Academic Material
#### [Mathematical Finance](./Mathematical%20Finance/): <br>
##### This section contains 3 Python-based projects: <br>

[AMF1](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF1.ipynb): Calculation of European options. <br>
[AMF2](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF2.ipynb): Implied Volatility calculation for European options, including a Volatility Smile visualization in a JPG file. <br>
[AMF_project](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF_project.ipynb) OOP: Object-Oriented Programming approach to calculate various types of options.<br>

### Applied Statistics and Econometrics (R-based):

#### Applied Statistics: 
##### Includes 4 sub-folders, each containing a PDF with tasks and solutions, R code files, and CSV data files:

[Assignment 1](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%201/BPT1_.pdf): Data visualization, linear regression analysis, linearity checks, and hypothesis testing with statistical t-tests. <br>
[Assignment 2](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%202/AS2.pdf): Logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis for classification. <br>
[Assignment 3](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%203/3_AS.pdf): Classification using random forest and bagging methods. <br>
[Additional Task](./Applied%20Statistics/Additional%20Task/Additional_Task_Report.pdf): A 10-page report on a classification model to differentiate between two types of wine using five statistical methods. <br>

#### Econometrics: Features two sub-folders with PDFs for tasks and solutions, R code, and CSV data:

Task: Selection of a functional form for linear regression, heteroskedasticity identification, variance modeling, and t- and F-tests, concluding with a prediction model. <br>
Additional_task: Complex multiple linear regression modeling for future wage performance prediction. <br>

#### Dissertation on AI-based Sentiment Analysis:
Focused on the HSBC project, my dissertation applied AI-based sentiment analysis to compare different strategies for improving trust between the bank and its customers. Utilizing Python and the nltk library, the model's construction is detailed in the "AI-based Sentiment Analysis" folder, accompanied by an academic report. The report covers task overview, AI mathematical theory, model construction, methodological steps, and outcomes.
