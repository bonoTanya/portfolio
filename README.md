# portfolio
The portfolio showcases academic work from master's course assignments, demonstrating practical expertise in Applied Statistics, Econometrics, Mathematical Finance, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). <br>

Additionally, it includes projects utilizing Excel and SQL for analyzing sales data and formulating performance improvement recommendations, a Python project addressing a company's churn issue, and a functional specification report from my Albany Beck Business Analysis training.

## Projects
#### [Excel Data Analysis project – Review of sales and profitability](Excel%20projects/Selling%20project/Report_Excel_Tatiana.pdf)
The report analyzes the company's sales and profitability to identify improvement areas and enhance sales.  <br>
The initial analysis highlighted statistical insights and areas needing deeper investigation, revealing significant profitability and quality/service issues.  <br>
Consequently, the report offers 5 specific recommendations to address these challenges. <br>
#### [BI Data Analysis Report - Review of GDP Economic Performance](Power%20BI/Economic%20Performance%20Report/GDP%20Economic%20Performance%20Report.pdf)
The report evaluates global economic performance by analyzing GDP data from various countries since 1961, using World Bank and OECD sources and Power BI for analysis.  <br>
It starts with a global overview, and then examines regional and country-specific GDP trends to predict future economic patterns.  <br>
The conclusion synthesizes the insights, offering a comprehensive summary of the findings. <br>
#### [Business Analysis – App Functional Specifications](Functional%20Specification/TB-Initial%20Functional%20Specification-300124-232700.pdf)
The project goal is to write the Functional Specification Document before 9th Feb. The [report](Functional%20Specification/TAA_project.pdf) has detailed information on the steps of crafting the document during the first two days.  <br>
As a result of the first days, the initial version of the document was created for key stakeholders to review.  <br>
The following tools were utilized: Confluence, JIRA, Lucidchart, and Figma. <br>
#### [SQL Data Analysis – Pizza Selling Project](SQL/Pizza%20selling%20project/PIZZA%20SELLING%20PROJECT.pdf)
The project seeks to boost pizza sales and profits next year through SQL analysis in MySQL Workbench.  <br>
Objectives include evaluating current pizza sales to identify top and bottom performers, pinpointing peak and low order times, and generating actionable recommendations.  <br>
The analysis yields six strategies for enhancing sales. <br>
#### [Python Data Analysis – Customer Churn Project](SME%20Customer%20Churn%20Project)
The analysis aims to identify factors contributing to customer churn and offer recommendations to address the issue.  <br>
The project is documented in two Python files: [the first](SME%20Customer%20Churn%20Project/stat_analysis.ipynb) covers basic statistics, data visualization, price sensitivity analysis, and correlation with churn, revealing a low correlation with price.  <br>
Based on these insights, [the second](SME%20Customer%20Churn%20Project/feature_engineering_and_modelling_model_answer.ipynb) file develops features affecting churn and constructs a predictive model using Random Forest.  <br>
The analysis identifies net margin and consumption as the most influential factors on churn. <br>

## Academic Material
#### [Mathematical Finance](./Mathematical%20Finance/) contains 3 Python-based projects: <br>

[AMF1](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF1.ipynb): Calculation of European options. <br>
[AMF2](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF2.ipynb): Implied Volatility calculation for European options, including a Volatility Smile visualization in a JPG file. <br>
[AMF_project](./Mathematical%20Finance/AMF_project.ipynb) OOP: Object-Oriented Programming approach to calculate various types of options.<br>

#### [Applied Statistics](./Applied%20Statistics/) includes 4 sub-folders, each containing a PDF with tasks and solutions, R code files, and CSV data files:

[Assignment 1](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%201/BPT1_.pdf): Data visualization, linear regression analysis, linearity checks, and hypothesis testing with statistical t-tests. <br>
[Assignment 2](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%202/AS2.pdf): Logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis for classification. <br>
[Assignment 3](./Applied%20Statistics/Assignment%203/3_AS.pdf): Classification using random forest and bagging methods. <br>
[Additional Task](./Applied%20Statistics/Additional%20Task/Additional_Task_Report.pdf): A 10-page report on a classification model to differentiate between two types of wine using five statistical methods. <br>

#### [Econometrics](./Econometrics/) features 2 sub-folders with PDFs for tasks and solutions, R code, and CSV data:

[Task](./Econometrics/Task): Selection of a functional form for linear regression, heteroskedasticity identification, variance modeling, and t- and F-tests, concluding with a prediction model. <br>
[Additional_task](./Econometrics/Additional%20Task): Complex multiple linear regression modeling for future wage performance prediction. <br>

#### Dissertation on [AI-based Sentiment Analysis](./AI-based%20Sentiment%20Analysis/):
Focused on the HSBC project, my dissertation applied AI-based sentiment analysis to compare different strategies for improving trust between the bank and its customers. Utilizing Python and the nltk library, the model's construction is detailed in the "AI-based Sentiment Analysis" folder, accompanied by an [academic report](./AI-based%20Sentiment%20Analysis/Academic%20Report.pdf). <br>
The report covers task overview, AI mathematical theory, model construction, methodological steps, and outcomes.
